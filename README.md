# Cryorack

The cryorack is a passive liquid nitrogen freezing system for cryovials.  This system is designed to cool twelve cryovials, each containing 1 mL of liquid sample, at -20 Â°C/min. This cooling rate has been found to produce good post-thaw motility in the sperm of several coral species.

Future versions of the design will be posted on this page once available.  Nothing is available here yet.
